Python | Socket | JSON | OS | Threading

Description:

•	Built a lightweight honeypot in Python to simulate common network services (FTP, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) and monitor unauthorized access attempts.

•	Captured and logged incoming connections with details such as timestamp, attacker IP, targeted port, and payload using structured JSON logging.

•	Employed multithreading to manage simultaneous connections and ensure real-time responsiveness across multiple ports.
